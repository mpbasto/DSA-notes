    "Selection sort breaks the input list in two parts: the sorted part which initially is empty, and the unsorted part which initially contains the list of all elements. The algorithm then selects the minimum value of the whole unsorted file, swaps it with the first unsorted value, and increases the sorted part by one.\n",
