    "Using the push() and pop() operations from stacks, we could implement enqueueing and dequeueing, so it is possible ot create queues using stacks, keeping in mind the FIFO(first-in first-out) principle.\n",
    "This implementation can be done in two forms:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the enqueue operation would have to be O(n) in time complexity;\n",
    " - the dequeue operation would have to be O(n) in time complexity;\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the first option, it is going to take two stacks(box1 and box2) that need to be kept in a way that allows the element inserted first to be always at the top of box1, and that we can simply use pop() for dequeue on box1. However, we would have to make the enqueued element reach the bottom of the stack for enqueueing.\n",
    "To do so, we will have to pop the elements of box1 one by one and push them onto box2. Then, we add the new element to box1. Finally, we pop everything from box2 again and push it back to box1, so that the new element gets placed at the bottom of the stack.\n",
