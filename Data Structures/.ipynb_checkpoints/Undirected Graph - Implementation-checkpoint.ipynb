    "Graphs are complex, non-linear data structures that are characterized by a group of vertices, connected by edges. Every vertex has a value associated with it. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the vertices would represent the cities. Edges represent the relationship between the vertices in the graph. Edges may or may not have a value associated with them. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the edges would represent the path between the cities.\n",

    "There are many applications of graphs, from schooling to business, and many operations can be performed with them. Besides visualising data, graphs can be used by social media platforms, for example, to represent different users as vertices and edges to represent the connections between them. As mentioned before, a mapping application can use graphs to represent places and the path (distance) between them."

    "An Adjacency List stores the nodes with which a particular node is connected to in a linked list or array. All these lists can be stored in a hash table, with the keys being the nodes, and the values being their respective lists. Example, A â†’ [(B, 4), (C, 1)] represents an adjacency list where the vertex A is connected to B (weight 4) and C (weight 1). This works really well for sparse graphs.\n",

    "An Adjacency Matrix is a very simple way to represent a graph. In a weighted graph, the element A[i][j] represents the cost of moving from vertex i to vertex j. In an unweighted graph, the element A[i][j] represents a Boolean value that determines whether a path exists from vertex i to vertex j. If A[i][j] == 0, then no path from vertex i to vertex j exists. If A[i][j] == 1, there is a path from vertex i to vertex j.\n",
